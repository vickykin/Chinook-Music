# Chinook Digital Music Store Queries
## by Victoria Bloomingdale

## Dataset
The Chinook database holds information about a digital media store, with tables for invoices, customers, artists, and albums. There are tables that are related to each other and is pre-populated with data. My goal was to assist the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. 

Questions that were asked:
1. Which artist earned the most revenue?
2. What were the top five albums?
3. What is the top genre in France?
4. Who is the best customer in Canada?
